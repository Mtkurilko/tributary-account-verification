## Key Findings

### 1. Algorithm Behavior Differences
- **SybilGuard**: More aggressive detection, tends to flag more nodes as suspicious
- **SybilLimit**: More conservative, focuses on high-confidence detections
- **Detection Overlap**: Higher agreement on smaller, denser graphs (100% vs 73%)

### 2. Performance Characteristics
- **Speed**: SybilGuard consistently 2-3x faster than SybilLimit
- **Scalability**: Both algorithms scale well, but SybilLimit's additional computations (mixing properties, balance verification) add overhead
- **Accuracy**: Both identify similar core suspicious nodes, with SybilLimit being more selective

### 3. Scoring Mechanisms
- **SybilGuard**: Continuous suspicion scores (0-1, higher = more suspicious)
- **SybilLimit**: Dual scoring system:
  - Suspicion scores (0-1, higher = more suspicious)
  - Acceptance probabilities (0-1, higher = more trusted)

### 4. Detection Strategies
- **SybilGuard**: 
  - Path diversity analysis
  - Attack edge detection (134 found in small dataset)
  - Clustering coefficient analysis
- **SybilLimit**: 
  - Balance verification
  - Mixing properties analysis
  - Acceptance probability calculation

## Algorithm Effectiveness

### Strengths of SybilGuard
1. **Speed**: Faster execution due to simpler calculations
2. **Sensitivity**: Catches more potential Sybils (higher recall)
3. **Attack Edge Detection**: Identifies potential attack vectors

### Strengths of SybilLimit
1. **Precision**: More selective, fewer false positives
2. **Trust Modeling**: Provides positive trust scores for legitimate nodes
3. **Balance Analysis**: Considers network flow balance

## Practical Implications

### When to Use SybilGuard
- High-speed detection needed
- Prefer higher recall (catch more Sybils, accept some false positives)
- Network attack analysis important

### When to Use SybilLimit
- Precision more important than recall
- Need trust scores for legitimate users
- Network has clear trust relationships
