## Abstract

Tributary, a new initiative founded by Professor Gormanly from Marist University, aims to be the "Wikipedia of all people". A critical step in achieving this vision is ensuring each person has a unique, one-to-one record. This paper investigates probabilistic deduplication using synthetic personal data, evaluating and comparing the effectiveness of three different models: a Transformer-based model, a Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT), and the traditional Fellegi-Sunter method. A custom-built dashboard was used to visualize performance in real time across a variety of error scenarios. Our results offer a roadmap to building an optimal deduplication system for user identity resolution.

## 1. Introduction

- Overview of record linkage and deduplication.
- Importance of accurate deduplication for platforms like Tributary.
- Challenges: spelling errors, missing data, varying field formats.
- Objectives:
  - Compare three deduplication models.
